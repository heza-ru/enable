# Quick Start: Adding Your Master Deck

Follow these 3 simple steps to get AI-generated presentations that match your company standards.

## Step 1: Extract Your Current Master Deck (30 minutes)

Open your existing PowerPoint master deck and for each slide type, note:

### What to Extract
- ✅ Slide title/heading
- ✅ Content structure (bullets, columns, etc.)
- ✅ Any icons or emojis used  
- ✅ Key messaging or standard phrases
- ✅ Visual layout (colors, fonts)

### Example
If you have a "Problem Slide" that looks like:

```
Title: "The Digital Adoption Challenge"
Icon: ⚠️
Content:
  - 73% of users don't fully utilize software
  - $1,200 average training cost per employee
  - 40% wasted software spend from low adoption
Visual: Orange/red accent colors
```

## Step 2: Fill in the Templates (30 minutes)

### A. Master Deck Structure (`master-deck-structure.md`)

Replace this:
```markdown
### 1. Title Slide
**Purpose:** First impression
**Typical Content:**
- [Add your title slide format here]
```

With your actual format:
```markdown
### 1. Title Slide  
**Purpose:** First impression and context setting
**Typical Content:**
- Whatfix logo in top right corner
- Large bold title (48pt)
- Subtitle: "[Customer Name] | [Date]"
- Blue gradient background (#0066FF to #0099FF)
```

### B. Slide Templates (`slide-templates.md`)

Replace this:
```markdown
## Problem/Challenge Slide Template
[Add your custom slide template here]
```

With your actual template:
```markdown
## Problem/Challenge Slide Template

# The Digital Adoption Challenge

## Organizations struggle with software ROI

- **73% of users** don't fully utilize enterprise software
- Training costs average **$1,200 per employee**
- Low adoption leads to **40% wasted spend**

⚠️ Icon: Top right corner

Notes: Build urgency. Ask if audience experiences similar challenges.
```

### C. Visual Guidelines (`visual-guidelines.md`)

Add your actual colors and icons:
```markdown
## Brand Colors
**Primary:** #0066FF (Whatfix Blue)
**Secondary:** #00CC88 (Success Green)
**Accent:** #FF6B00 (Action Orange)

## Standard Icons
- 💰 ROI, cost savings
- 📈 Growth, improvements
- ⚠️ Problems, challenges
```

### D. Messaging Framework (`messaging-framework.md`)

Add your real messaging:
```markdown
## Elevator Pitch
Whatfix is the Digital Adoption Platform that provides in-app guidance, 
helping organizations maximize software ROI and boost user productivity.

## Key Differentiators vs. Competitors
- Real-time in-app guidance (not just training videos)
- No-code content creation
- Enterprise-grade analytics
```

## Step 3: Test & Iterate (15 minutes)

### Test It
Ask the AI:
```
"Create a sales presentation for a healthcare customer 
focusing on compliance and user adoption"
```

### Check the Output
- ✅ Does it use your slide structure?
- ✅ Does it match your messaging?
- ✅ Does it use your icons?
- ✅ Does it feel "on-brand"?

### Iterate
If something's off, update the relevant template file and test again!

1. 3-5 most common slide types
2. Your core messaging
3. Your brand colors

### Use Real Examples
Copy actual text from your best presentations. Real examples work better than descriptions.

### Be Specific
Instead of: "Use corporate colors"
Write: "Primary: #0066FF, Secondary: #00CC88"

### Include Context
Add "when to use" guidance for each template.

### Update Regularly  
As your messaging evolves, update the templates. Treat this as a living document.
