# Enable Environment Variables Example
# 
# Enable is a client-side-only application and doesn't require
# environment variables for basic functionality.
#
# Copy this file to .env.local if you want to customize:
# cp .env.example .env.local

# REQUIRED: NONE! 🎉
# ============================================
# Enable stores API keys client-side only.
# Users enter their Claude API key in the UI.

# NOTES
# ============================================
# 
# 1. API Keys: NEVER store Claude API keys in environment variables!
#    Users enter them directly in the UI.
#
# 2. Security: This file is safe to commit (no secrets).
#    Real secrets go in .env.local (gitignored).
#
# 3. Client-side: Only NEXT_PUBLIC_* variables are exposed to the browser.
#    Since Enable is client-side only, use NEXT_PUBLIC_* prefix.
#
# 4. Deployment: Most hosting platforms auto-configure their own variables.
#    You typically don't need to set these manually.
